# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.


### Contribution process

1. Explain your idea and discuss your plan in a GitHub Issue.
1. Prepare a git commit with your change. Don't forget to
   add tests.
   Run the existing tests with `bazel test //...`.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
   This will start the code review process. **All submissions, including
   submissions by project members, require review.**
1. You may be asked to make some changes. You'll also need to sign the CLA at
   this point, if you haven't done so already. Our continuous integration bots
   will test your change automatically on supported platforms. Once everything
   looks good, your change will be merged.
